# Vibrating-Tumbler

### Introduction:
This project focuses on valorization of scrap. This readme file gives a brief glimpse of design and working of Vibrating tumbler which is used to remove the rust on the rusted things with the help of vibration.
As the name of vibrating tumbler is evident by name its name it is mainly a tumbler and it is vibrated accordingly to generate vibrations and this vibrations are used to rub the test material and remove the rust to
great extent.

Why do we need vibrating tumblers? <br/>
❑ Instead of removing rust by hand rubbing which needs lot of human effort we can use this vibrating tumbler. <br/>
❑ Vibratory finishing is now the most popular type of mass finishing and, next to hand deburring, the most common surface conditioning method used by industry. <br/>
❑ This versatile process is used for cleaning, deburring, deflashing, descaling, edge and corner radiusing, surface finishing, and stress relieving. <br/>
<br/>
In which places vibrating tumblers can be used? <br/>
❑ The vibrating tumblers are widely used in industry scale to remove rust and give coating to the test material. <br/>
❑ But the vibrating tumbler done in this project can be used at any place until and unless electricity supply is available. So this makes a lot of difference. The vibrating tumbler designed here can be used for home appliances comfortable at any place(provide 30 V voltage is available) <br/>
