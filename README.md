## Introduction:
This project focuses on valorization of scrap. This readme file gives a brief glimpse of design and working of Vibrating tumbler which is used to remove the rust on the rusted things with the help of vibration.
As the name of vibrating tumbler is evident by name its name it is mainly a tumbler and it is vibrated accordingly to generate vibrations and this vibrations are used to rub the test material and remove the rust to
great extent.

### Why do we need vibrating tumblers? <br/>
❑ Instead of removing rust by hand rubbing which needs lot of human effort we can use this vibrating tumbler. <br/>
❑ Vibratory finishing is now the most popular type of mass finishing and, next to hand deburring, the most common surface conditioning method used by industry. <br/>
❑ This versatile process is used for cleaning, deburring, deflashing, descaling, edge and corner radiusing, surface finishing, and stress relieving. <br/>
<br/>

### In which places vibrating tumblers can be used? <br/>
❑ The vibrating tumblers are widely used in industry scale to remove rust and give coating to the test material. <br/>
❑ But the vibrating tumbler done in this project can be used at any place until and unless electricity supply is available. So this makes a lot of difference. The vibrating tumbler designed here can be used for home appliances comfortable at any place(provide 30 V voltage is available) <br/>


### Design: <br/>
A vibrating tumbler is built by placing the tumbler on a wooden piece which is vibrated by placing computer fan under it. The vibrations are created on the base by using springs and computer fan. 
Computer fan provides upward push and also toggling effect because of eccentric mass.

This vibrating tumbler is tested against different arrangements and different set ups.

The fluctuations which are done here for the model after building are changing the media, changing the eccentric mass. Test samples are tested against these different set ups to observe the importance of each fluctuation.

### Role of eccentric mass:

From the below picture we can note the effect of eccentric mass, a toggling effect is created to the vibrating tumbler.
The location of the eccentric will create load on the corresponding spring and this will infact create toggling effect. More is the eccentric mass more are the vibrations.

### Experiments done so far:
1) Vibrating tumbler with media wall nut shell powder <br/>
   [Experimentation](https://youtu.be/xbLiMERdkcY) <br/>
   [Result](https://youtu.be/CHZ_myWAJmk)
3) Vibrating tumbler with media wall nut shell powder + Al2O3 <br/>
   [Experimentation](https://youtu.be/VJRho5P2fi4) <br/>
   [Result](https://youtu.be/iA2bA8FPogc)
   ![before and after](https://github.com/112101011/Vibrating-Tumbler/assets/111628378/1316997c-0d20-4e7d-b86a-496762f67728) <br/>
   (From the clear observation we can see that some resut is removed on the bolt). <br/>
   <br/>
   Observation: Media : wall nut shell granulates + aluminum oxide is giving good result when compared to media: wall nut shell powder.
5) Vibrating tumbler with media sand. <br/>
   [Experimentation and result](https://youtu.be/4fO6b7y3-aM)
6) Vibrating tumbler with corn cob media. <br/>
   [Experimentation and results](https://youtu.be/48lnPWOkiCg)
7) Vibrating tumbler with SiC abrasives. <br/>
   [Experimentation](https://youtu.be/r87f6U2eviE) <br/>
   [Results](https://youtu.be/kxEg5nYQuJ8)

### Observations made so far:
By observing the above results the results were good for wall nut shell
powder with Al2O3 and SiC. These materials are showing good results
compared to other media. I have observed the following:
(freq)no-material > (freq)corn-cob > (freq)wall-nut shell powder

### Conclusion & Future scope:
More media can be used to test the model and come to a conclusion
which media is better over another. The depth of rust removed can be
compared from different media.
